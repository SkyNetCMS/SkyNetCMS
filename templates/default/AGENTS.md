# Site Development

Static site built with Vite, served by nginx.

## Structure

- `src/` - source files (edit here)
- `dist/` - build output (never edit)

## Workflow

After every change: `npm run build` then commit with context.

## Approach

Start with plain HTML/CSS/JS. Add dependencies only when clearly beneficial - inform user first.

Constraints: static only (no backend), Vite ecosystem.

## Priorities

1. Responsive design (mobile-first)
2. Modern, clean visuals
3. SEO (semantic HTML, meta tags)

## First Edit

Replace welcome page entirely when user requests real content.
